# WordPress SFTP Deployer

A powerful WordPress plugin for deploying static websites via SFTP with secure credential handling and live deployment tracking.

## Description

WordPress SFTP Deployer provides an efficient way to package and deploy static website files from your WordPress installation to any remote server via SFTP. Perfect for deploying static sites, staging environments, or backing up critical files.

## Integration with Simply Static

This plugin is designed to work seamlessly with Simply Static's local directory export option:

1. Configure Simply Static to export your WordPress site to a local directory
2. In SFTP Deployer, set that same local directory as your "Source Path"
3. After generating your static site with Simply Static, use SFTP Deployer to upload and extract it to your remote server

This workflow creates a powerful static site deployment pipeline that maintains all the SEO benefits of static sites while providing a user-friendly WordPress editing experience.

## Features

- **Secure Password Storage**: All SFTP credentials are encrypted using WordPress salts and OpenSSL
- **Multiple Connection Methods**: Uses phpseclib 3.0 with fallback to native SSH2 extension
- **Simple Deployment**: Package, upload, and extract files in one click
- **Live Deployment Logs**: Watch the deployment process in real-time
- **Test Mode**: Verify your configuration without making actual changes
- **Custom Log Paths**: Configure where logs are stored for better organization
